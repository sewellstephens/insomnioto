Alternatively, you can use our web based client.


## Backstory

Insomnioto is a fork of [ArchGPT/insomnium](https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnium) is a fork of [Kong/insomnia at 2023.5.8](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia), the last commit before compulsory account login was introduced. In a sense, Insomnioto is a community response to [the latest product update that forces account creation w/o warning](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37680522).

![HN](https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnium/blob/main/hn.png?raw=true)

I was among the users who were deeply affected by the recent change. I still think Insomnia is a nice product in general, but I have to disagree with the direction it is going. So I have decided to fork it and make it 100% local and privacy-focused.

## Develop Insomnioto

Development on Insomnioto can be done on Mac, Windows, or Linux as long as you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). See the `.nvmrc` file located in the project for the correct Node version.
